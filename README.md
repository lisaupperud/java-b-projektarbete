This project involves creating a text-based adventure game set in a house at night. The player begins in a central location, such as a living room, and can move between different rooms in the house. The goal is to interact with objects and solve challenges, such as finding a frying pan in the kitchen to increase damage in a fight against an intruder. The game progresses as the player defeats the intruder and contacts the police, marking the end of the game.

The project builds on concepts learned in the course, including object-oriented programming, where various locations and interactions are modeled using Java classes. Players will navigate between rooms and interact with objects that affect the gameâ€™s outcome. The game world consists of a central location and four rooms, each with unique characteristics. This project emphasizes developing interactive, event-driven logic and understanding how to structure and manage a small-scale game.
